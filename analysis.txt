 Result Analysis: β-VAE Based Anomaly Detection on MNIST

 1. Overview of Results

This section provides a detailed analysis of the experimental results obtained from the β-VAE anomaly detection model trained on the MNIST dataset. The model was trained exclusively on digit 1, treating all other digits as anomalies during testing.

Two configurations were evaluated:

 β = 1.0 (Standard VAE)
 β = 2.0 (Stronger KL regularization)



 2. Training Loss Behaviour

 Observed Training Loss

 For β = 1.0, the loss reduced from **177.69** to **56.65**
 For β = 2.0, the loss reduced from **182.83** to **62.06**

 Interpretation

 The steady decrease in loss indicates stable and successful training
 Higher loss values for β = 2.0 are expected due to stronger KL regularization
 β = 1.0 achieves better reconstruction quality, while β = 2.0 enforces a more structured latent space



 3. Precision Analysis

 Observed Value

 Precision = 1.000 for both β values

 Interpretation

 A precision of 1.0 means all samples classified as anomalies are truly anomalous
 The model is highly conservative and avoids false positives
 This behaviour is desirable in safety-critical anomaly detection systems



 4. Recall Analysis

 Observed Value

 Recall = 0.011 for both β values

 Interpretation

 Low recall indicates that only a small fraction of anomalies are detected
 This occurs because the anomaly threshold is set at the 99th percentile
 Only the most extreme reconstruction errors are flagged as anomalies

This trade-off intentionally favors precision over recall.



 5. ROC-AUC Analysis

 Observed Value

 AUC ≈ 0.999 for both β values

 Interpretation

 A near-perfect AUC indicates excellent separation between normal and anomalous samples
 Even though recall is low at the chosen threshold, the overall ranking of anomaly scores is highly accurate
 This suggests that adjusting the threshold can significantly improve recall



 6. Comparison Between β = 1.0 and β = 2.0

 Aspect                  β = 1.0   β = 2.0        
  
 Reconstruction Quality  Better    Slightly worse 
 Latent Regularization   Moderate  Strong         
 Loss Value              Lower     Higher         
 Precision               1.000     1.000          
 Recall                  0.011     0.011          
 AUC                     0.999     0.999          

 Key Insight

In this experiment, increasing β did not significantly change anomaly detection performance because the digit class (1) is visually distinct from other digits in MNIST.



 7. Limitations of the Experiment

 MNIST does not contain real-world anomalies
 Anomalies were synthetically defined using class labels
 Fully connected architecture limits spatial feature learning
 Fixed percentile threshold restricts recall



 8. Recommendations for Improvement

 Use convolutional VAE (Conv-VAE) for better image representation
 Experiment with lower percentile thresholds (e.g., 95%) to improve recall
 Apply the method to more complex datasets such as EMNIST or industrial defect data
 Perform latent space visualization to analyze feature disentanglement



9. Final Conclusion

The β-VAE model demonstrates strong anomaly detection capability on MNIST, achieving perfect precision and near-perfect AUC. Although recall is low due to strict thresholding, the results confirm that reconstruction error is a reliable indicator of abnormality. The experiment successfully validates β-VAE as an effective unsupervised anomaly detection approach.
