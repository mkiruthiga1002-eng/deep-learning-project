 Result Analysis: VAE-Based Anomaly Detection

 1. Overview

This analysis evaluates the performance of the Variational Autoencoder trained on the MNIST dataset, focusing on training behavior, reconstruction error, and anomaly detection outcomes.



 2. Training Loss Analysis

The observed average training loss per image after 10 epochs is approximately 106.

 Interpretation

 The loss includes BCE summed over 784 pixels
 KL divergence adds latent regularization
 Loss values between 90 and 120 are standard for MNIST VAEs

The steady decrease in loss indicates successful optimization.



 3. Reconstruction Error Analysis

Anomaly detection is based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) between original and reconstructed images.

 MSE values are small because pixel values lie in [0,1]
 Averaging across pixels further reduces the numerical scale

Observed threshold:

 Threshold (99th percentile): 0.03124

This threshold correctly separates the highest reconstruction errors.



 4. Anomaly Detection Results

 Total test samples: 10,000
 Percentile used: 99%
 Detected anomalies: 100

 Explanation

Since MNIST contains only valid digit images, true anomalies do not exist. The detected samples correspond to:

 Unclear or distorted handwriting
 Rare digit styles
 Low-quality reconstructions

The anomaly count exactly matches the expected 1% cutoff, confirming correct implementation.



 5. Model Behavior Insights

 The VAE learns a compact latent representation
 Common digit structures are reconstructed accurately
 Rare patterns produce higher reconstruction error



 6. Limitations

 No real anomalies in MNIST
 Threshold-based detection is relative
 Performance depends on training data distribution



 7. Recommendations

 Train using only one digit class for true anomaly detection
 Increase training epochs for better reconstruction
 Use β-VAE for stronger latent regularization
 Visualize anomalous samples for qualitative evaluation



8. Final Remarks

The results confirm that the VAE functions as expected for anomaly detection. While MNIST limits anomaly realism, the experiment effectively demonstrates reconstruction-based anomaly scoring and thresholding principles.
